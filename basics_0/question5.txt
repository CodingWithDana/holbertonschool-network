The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, to check if other network devices are available on the network.
The command ping uses ICMP to make sure that a network device remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.

Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
Requirements:
    - Accepts a string as an argument
    - Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
    - Ping the IP 5 times

It is interesting to look at the time value, which is the time that it took for the ICMP request to go to the 8.8.8.8 IP and come back to my host. 
The IP 8.8.8.8 is owned by Google, and the quickest roundtrip between my computer and Google was 7.57 ms which is pretty fast, which is a sign that the 
network path between my computer and Google's datacenter is in good shape. A slow ping would indicate a slow network.

Next time you feel that your connection is slow, try the ping command to see what is going on!
